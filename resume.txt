I strive to build applications and websites which people will find delightful to use. I'm a graphic designer, but I'm also a programmer and I live and breathe code. In my work, behavior is design (and design is behavior), so designing, building, and prototyping simultaneously is paramount. 

This means I spend as much time in Photoshop, Illustrator and Sketch.app as I do in TextMate, Eclipse and Xcode. By day I'm primarily responsible for web design and Javascript programming but in my free time I write graphics code in C++/OpenGL and apps/games/interactive doodads in C/ObjectiveC/Java/NodeJS and so on.
