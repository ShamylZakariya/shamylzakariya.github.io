I strive to build applications and websites which people will find delightful to use. I'm a graphic designer, but I'm also a programmer and I live and breathe code. In my work, behavior is design (and design is behavior), so designing, building, and prototyping simultaneously is paramount. 

This means I spend as much time in Photoshop, Illustrator and Sketch as I do in TextMate, Eclipse, Xcode and the terminal. By day I'm primarily responsible for web design, print design, and Javascript programming; but in my free time I write graphics code in C++/OpenGL and apps/games/interactive doodads in C/ObjectiveC/Java/NodeJS and so on.

1997-1999: Darden School of Business, Charlottesville VA
Graphic designer, programmer

At Darden I designed & built educational software in Macromedia Flash and Director. 

1999-present: APCO Worldwide, Washington DC (later Seattle, WA)

At APCO Worldwide I'm responsible for working with clients to design websites, print materials, and mobile applications. When my responsibility includes building them, I build them using modern standards and practices, and I maintain and update them as time moves on.
