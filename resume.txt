I strive to build products which people will find delightful to use. I'm a graphic designer, but I'm also a programmer and I live and breathe code as much as design. In my work, behavior is design (and design is behavior), so designing, building, and prototyping simultaneously is paramount. 

This means I spend as much time in Photoshop, Illustrator and Sketch as I do in TextMate, IntelliJ IDEA, Xcode and the terminal. By day I'm primarily responsible for logo design, web design, print design, user interface design, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript development; but in my free time I write graphics code in C++/OpenGL and apps/games/interactive doodads in C/C++/Objective-C/Swift/Java/Node and so on.


Career:
1997-1999: Darden School of Business, Charlottesville VA
Graphic designer, programmer

At Darden I designed & built educational software in Macromedia Flash and Director. 

1999-2016: APCO Worldwide, Washington DC (later Seattle, WA)
Art director, client-side web programmer

At APCO Worldwide I was responsible for working with clients to design logos, websites, print materials, web applications, and native mobile applications. Further, I did UX sketches and refinement, and prototyped user interface interaction. When my responsibility included building the final product, I built it using modern standards and practices appropriate to the platform; finally, I maintained and updated the products over time.
